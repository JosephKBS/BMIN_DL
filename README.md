# Pneumonia Chest X-ray Image Classification

- This is README file for the paper "Pneumonia Chest X-ray Image Classification". This paper is a final project report for the Deep learning in Medicine (BMIN-GA 3007) at Department of Biomedical Informatics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
------------------------------------------------------

## [Abstract]
Deep learning-based model has been suggested to aid medical diagnosis process due to its efficiency and reliability in performance due to an expected shortage in physicians in the United States. This paper attempts to achieve a clinician level-accuracy in Pneumonia disease detection with chest X-ray images using multiple deep learning-based models, espe- cially using convolutional neural network, including ResNet and InceptionV3. The models reached a high performance(81%) but unsuccessful in outperforming the average clinicianâ€™s diagnosis accuracy(86%).
